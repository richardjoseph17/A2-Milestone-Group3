    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>To Create an inclusive, inviting concert atmosphere where audiences can better experience, understand and enjoy the music for themselves, We at TCMC are focused to make an online platform to increase the number of members and spread your talent to the world which also helps in increasing the popularity of classical music in society and to present a world class music..</p>
    <h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
    <p>Brief details of who did what</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manoj Sarangan: </strong>CSS,HTML,Javascript,Image editing,Group Meetings Planning,Plan Finishing,Github Uploading and basically all font and size work were done in website. </li>
        <li><strong>Richard Joseph: </strong> CSS,HTML,Plan Content, Website Design,Github Uploading and supporting for Proof Reading and helped the team.</li>
        <li><strong>Khaja Sulthan Allaudeen: </strong>CSS, HTML, plan, Did content preparation for the website and images for the website</li>
        <li><strong>Vijay Saradhi: </strong>CSS, HTML, Did the images, Bulletin page Content and proof reading</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Testing Details</h2>
    <p>The key of successful test strategies is picking the right level of testing at each stage of the project. We had developed website with Dreamweaver, Notepad++ and we have tested the website according to our test cases and checked functionalities. All error cases should be verified and required to end gracefully with the appropriate
error data reported (i.e., handle the error; don't allow the program to terminate on an
error). This may include executing re-start logic, recovery from the error, or a graceful
shutdown. These tests, which are usually performed by clients or end-users, are
not usually focused on identifying simple problems such as spelling
errors and cosmetic problems, nor show stopper defects , because this
has to be done early stages of levels. As a tester the most important responsibilities are writing the test cases, to test software quality, performing regression and negative tests, Test the user interface and app compatibility with various browsers.  </p>

    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>Your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Our project is uploaded in git-hub continuously so that all of our team members can view to make changes in-case if it does not meet the requirements. Everyone shared their knowledge which leads to gaining idea on website designing. Distribution of the functionalities among team leads to completion the project soon. We helped each other in all phases when it is required to complete a good product.  </p>
    <p><strong>Minuses:  </strong>Working in collaboration will always bring with it its own challenges, as different minds, skill-sets and personalities combine to bring about a shared outcome. We felt that coordinate of team was bit difficult at beginning and to separate requirements for web designing among the team members.
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> Java-script learning was very interesting and working sleeplessly was fun moreover its quiet interesting to debug the bugs in the code. As there are four members in our team, we split the work as designing, developing, testing and uploading which helps in completing the task in right time and to improve the quality.
	  An infrastructure that allows us to work from anywhere and push it through git hub makes it easy to complete the project.</p>
